</github-draft-issue>

The user stories I've created are specifically designed to be implementable by an AI-based coder because they:

1. **Reference specific API endpoints** from the provided YAML specification
2. **Include clear technical details** about implementation approaches
3. **Specify concrete acceptance criteria** that can be objectively verified
4. **Break down complex features** into manageable components
5. **Reference specific Apple frameworks and APIs** with their proper names and functions
6. **Include modern Apple platform features** that have well-documented APIs and implementation patterns

The stories also incorporate modern Apple platform behaviors such as:
- SwiftUI interfaces and animations
- Dark Mode support
- Widget functionality
- SharePlay for collaborative experiences
- App Clips for lightweight experiences
- Spotlight integration
- iCloud syncing
- On-Demand Resources
- Universal Purchase across Apple devices
- Handoff and Continuity features
- Siri Shortcuts integration

These user stories provide a comprehensive roadmap for developing a modern, feature-rich iOS app that leverages both the Rebrickable API and Apple's platform capabilities while being structured in a way that an AI-based coder can successfully implement them.
