# Rebrickable Mobile App Analysis & User Story Generation Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for an LLM to analyze the Rebrickable website and generate comprehensive user stories for a mobile application. The analysis should result in well-structured GitHub issues organized into meaningful milestones for agile development.

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### Step 1: Comprehensive Website Analysis

#### 1.1 Primary Analysis Tasks
Execute these analysis tasks in order:

1. **Homepage Deep Dive**
   - Visit https://rebrickable.com/
   - Document all visible features, navigation elements, and user actions
   - Identify the main value propositions presented to users
   - Note the statistical information (164,770 MOCs, 25,524 sets, etc.)

2. **Navigation Structure Analysis**
   - Map out the main navigation menu structure
   - Document the "Build", "MOCs", "Sets", "Parts", "Discuss" sections
   - Analyze user account management flows
   - Identify search and discovery mechanisms

3. **Core Feature Deep Dive**
   Analyze each major section:
   - **MOCs Section**: Browse custom designs, filter options, premium vs free
   - **Sets Database**: Official LEGO set catalog and information
   - **Parts Database**: Individual part lookup and specifications  
   - **Build Tools**: Collection management and build matching
   - **User Profiles**: Designer profiles and social features
   - **Marketplace**: Premium MOC buying/selling functionality

4. **User Flow Documentation**
   Document these critical user journeys:
   - New user registration and onboarding
   - MOC discovery and viewing instructions
   - Collection import and management
   - Build matching workflow
   - Designer following and community interaction

#### 1.2 Mobile Experience Considerations
For each feature identified, evaluate:
- **Touch Interface Suitability**: How well does this translate to mobile?
- **Performance Requirements**: What are the data/bandwidth implications?
- **Offline Capabilities**: What could work without internet?
- **Mobile-Specific Enhancements**: What could be better on mobile?

### Step 2: API Mapping and Technical Analysis

#### 2.1 API Endpoint Review
Using the provided `legoAPI.yaml`, map website features to available endpoints:

**Core Data Endpoints:**
- `/api/v3/lego/sets/` - Official LEGO sets
- `/api/v3/lego/parts/` - LEGO parts database  
- `/api/v3/lego/minifigs/` - Minifigure database
- `/api/v3/lego/colors/` - Color specifications
- `/api/v3/lego/themes/` - LEGO themes

**Relationship Endpoints:**
- `/api/v3/lego/sets/{set_num}/parts/` - Parts in specific sets
- `/api/v3/lego/parts/{part_num}/colors/` - Available colors for parts
- `/api/v3/lego/sets/{set_num}/minifigs/` - Minifigs in sets

#### 2.2 Feature-API Alignment
Create a mapping document showing:
- ‚úÖ Features fully supported by API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Features partially supported (requiring workarounds)
- ‚ùå Features not supported by current API
- üí° Mobile-specific features that could be added

### Step 3: User Story Creation Framework

#### 3.1 User Personas (Primary Focus)
Create user stories for these personas, prioritized by importance:

1. **LEGO Collector** (Primary) - Manages collection, seeks buildable MOCs
2. **Casual Builder** (Primary) - Occasional use, wants inspiration  
3. **MOC Designer** (Secondary) - Creates content, needs community features
4. **LEGO Parent** (Secondary) - Family collection management
5. **Set Enthusiast** (Tertiary) - Focuses on official sets and alternatives

#### 3.2 Story Structure Template
Use this exact format for every user story:

```markdown
## User Story
As a [persona type],
I want [specific functionality],
So that [clear benefit/value].

## Description  
[2-3 sentences describing the feature in detail]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 2]  
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion 3]
- [ ] [Additional criteria as needed]

## API Requirements
- **Primary Endpoint**: [Main API endpoint from legoAPI.yaml]
- **Supporting Endpoints**: [Any additional endpoints needed]
- **Authentication**: [Required/Optional]
- **Rate Limiting**: [Considerations for mobile usage]

## Technical Considerations
- **Mobile Optimization**: [Specific mobile requirements]
- **Performance**: [Loading time, data usage expectations]

#### 4.2 Story Prioritization Matrix

Use this framework to prioritize each story:

**Priority Scoring (1-5 scale):**
- **User Value**: How much value does this provide?
- **Business Impact**: Does this drive engagement/retention?
- **Technical Feasibility**: How complex is implementation?
- **API Support**: Is this well-supported by the API?
- **Mobile Suitability**: Does this work well on mobile?

**Priority Categories:**
- **Must Have (Score 20-25)**: Critical for MVP
- **Should Have (Score 15-19)**: Important for user experience
- **Could Have (Score 10-14)**: Nice additions
- **Won't Have (Score < 10)**: Future consideration

### Step 5: GitHub Issues Creation

#### 5.1 Issue Creation Process
For each user story created:

1. **Create as GitHub Issue** using the existing import script structure
2. **Apply appropriate labels**:
   - Epic labels (epic:authentication, epic:collection, etc.)
   - Priority labels (priority:must-have, priority:should-have)  
   - Complexity labels (complexity:medium, complexity:high)
   - Platform labels (platform:ios, platform:all)

3. **Assign to correct milestone**:
   - v1.0 for Must-Have features
   - v1.1 for Should-Have features  
   - v1.2 for Could-Have features

4. **Link related issues** using GitHub's linking syntax

#### 5.2 Issue Quality Checklist
Before creating each issue, verify:
- [ ] Story follows standard user story format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] API requirements are clearly documented
- [ ] Story is properly sized (1-8 story points)
